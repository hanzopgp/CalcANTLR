# CalcANTLR

## Presentation :

>This is a calculator language compiler done with ANTLR for my Language Theory / Compiler classes.

## How does it work :

>I'm using ANTLR to generate a java lexer and parser with a grammar file. The "calculator language" is made of numbers, operators, spaces, brackets... The purpose of the grammar I've built is to translate the calculator language into stack machine. We can then run this stack machine language (which looks like assembly but without register).
